All "root authored and root committed" commits were made by me, ha0406.
All commits authored by ha0406 were also made by me.

I have found that Github was very inconsistent in establishing me as an author on my commits.
This could be due to a lot of reasons but all of the commits made by either ha0406 or "root authored and root committed" are still mine.

I especially don't want to manually edit the Github history of the commits for this assignment to attempt to change the "root authored and root committed" to me,
ha0406, because I don't want to make a large mistake in the last minute that is not even directly connected to the execution of the final assignment.
This is a safer way that you can see exactly what I've done.

All of these commits in this repo were also made by me (alongside the commits that Github gave me direct credit for):

Remaining planning notes:
   
   - Figure out why front end is being served raw HTML instead of Scripts.js src
   
   - Use jquery API on search?
   

Miscellaneous Notes:

   - Whole assignment is fully functional in "npm run test"
   
   - Images have been posted.
